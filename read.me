# Spelling Game App 📚🎮

This is a mobile spelling game built using **.NET MAUI**. It’s designed to help users—especially young learners—improve their spelling through a fun, level-based progression system categorized by school grade (e.g., Grade 1, Grade 2, etc.).

## 🌟 Features

- 🎓 **Grade-based Levels**: Each grade (e.g., Grade 1, 2, 3) has 50+ levels, each with unique word challenges.
- 🔐 **Locked Progression**: You must complete Level N before accessing Level N+1. Each grade is unlocked by completing the previous one.
- ❤️ **Lives System**: You get 3 attempts per word. If you fail all 3, the level resets.
- ⏳ **Splash Screen**: Custom splash screen included, replaces default .NET purple screen.
- 💡 **Auto-Verification**: Words are checked immediately after input—no need to press a "Verify" button.
- 📦 **Offline-Ready**: No internet required once the app is installed.
